# PhonePdf

This repo contains 2 course notes from
https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/, formatted for phone screens.
All the credit and goes to the original author. I might have
introduced formatting problems, so please check the official PDF if
you encounter one.

The following adjustments are made:

- PDF size adjusted for phone screen
- Adjusted font to be more like sans-serif, for screen reading
- Shrank some diagrams
- Long formulas were broke into multiple lines.
